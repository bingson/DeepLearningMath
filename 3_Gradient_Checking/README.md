## 1_Gradient_Checking.ipynb

You will be implementing gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. By completing this assignment you will

- implement gradient checking from scratch;

- understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation;

- recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula;

- learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
