## Part 1 
#### P1_Building_DeepNeuralNetwork.ipynb (web optimized view http://bit.ly/2PSt7Dx)
In this assignment you will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in Part 2 to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will
- develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network;
- write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network;
- initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

This assignment prepares you well for the upcoming assignment. Take your time to complete it and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. 

## Part 2 
#### P2_Application_DeepNeuralNetwork.ipynb (web optimized view http://bit.ly/2PVeQ90)
In an earlier assignment, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this assignment, you will:
- learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want;
- experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves;
- recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.

This assignment prepares you well for the next course which dives deep into the techniques and strategies for parameters tuning and initializations. Take your time to complete this assignment and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises.
